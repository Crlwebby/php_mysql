​		Begin at 2020.10.07, aim at reading the book 《PHP and MySQL Web Development》

​		20 pages per day，more would be better. I hope I can finished it in a month.


       10.24 I'm a little tired about reading such a tome. I have skipped a lot of pages to catch up with the progress about 20 pages per day.
       Maybe I should just read the first three parts. There are still many interesting skills I want to learn,but not learn it from this book. 
       Okay, I decided. I will read the remain 14 chapters selectively, according to what I am interested in.

       Basic decision:
       18--network and protocal
       19--manage the date and time
       20--internationlize and localize
       22--php sessiono control
       23--javascript and php
       24--other useful skills about php
       25--huge project regulation
       27--create user authenticate
       28--laravel
